	y ^= x;
	x ^= y;
}

Backtracking

-Pick a starting point
-While the problem isn't solved
       -For each path from the starting point
             -Set that as the starting point and recurse
             -If it returns true, then return true
       -Undo the current move (since none of the options panned out)
       -Return false
